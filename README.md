Overbank is a simple application for categorizing banklog entries in CSV format.
The intention is to have a simple way of organizing all the information that banks allow you to export in CSV, 
categorizing them automatically, and presenting overall results.
This is a work in progress, poorly documented and extremely unstructured.
