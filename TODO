-> Though I'm syncing prefs, they alawys start from scratch when launching the program.

· Rewrite preferences as predicates or NSTokenFields in NSTableView, editable.

· Test multiyear bar graph in histogram.
· Remove the black line at the top of the green INCOME bar.
· Re-write the method "computeAggregatedCategories" within Database.
  Place it within PieChart, and avoid running a "fetch". Use the arraycontrollers
  instead.
· Progress bar when importing and when "matching" new data.
· Forget every association. Cmd-F
· Make stats' tab, tabView and entries view shorter
· Display the mean when a category is selected in Statistics view.
· Export categorized entries as CSV.
· Write Unit Tests
· Refactor to fllow Uncle Bob's "The only way to be really be sure that a function does one thing is to extract 
  'til you drop."
x Use NSSet instead of NSArray when fastImporting new log files from CSV to the database.
- Add gradients to the colors in the pie chart, and same base colors always (instead of random)
x Select all categories when trying to draw a pie chart.
x Enable selection of what categories to include in the PIE chart.
x Use a separate Category Controller for the categories listing in the pie chart.
x Change the randomColors in PieChart by known pastel color palette.
x Importing RAW CSV converted files DOESN'T WORK
x  I'm getting the row and column of the NSTokenField cell being edited. Need to write he code
   to store changes in the Prefs Object, properly. It is LOCATED in the method "setObjectValue"
   in prefsViewController.
x I'm in the middle of displaying the list of categories in the preferences window. I tried to use a
  CoreData-based Array Controller, but I'm duplicating controller and I'm not sure whether that will impact
  performance or if it will even work well. I decided to
    · Access preferences array controller programatically
    · Use a class that will allow me to do anything I want to make (WHAT DO I NEED TO DO WITH PREFS from the
      preferences Window????)
    · Continue working with the NSTokenFieldCells in the table
